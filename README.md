# ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ± ManGo: A Mango Farming Assistant App ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±

The main objective of this study is to design and develop an app that helps new farmers grow crops on their own. Specifically, it aims to:
1.	Provide a Platform for sharing about fruit farming.
2.	Provide a function can detect the category of a fruit through image-processing. (unripe, ripe, overripe, rotten).
3.	Provide a function that displaces basic information about fruit farming.

## Description

		ManGo is an agricultural mobile-based application where it helps the user to grow healthy 
    fruit crops with the guide of the application that we will create. ManGo also has a feature 
    similar to StackOverflow where users can share ideas and information with other users of the 
    application. It will can be also use as a handbook due to the information that will store in 
    the application. The main feature of this app is that it has an image processing system where 
    it can identify whether the harvested mango is categorized on the list (unripe, ripe, overripe, rotten).
